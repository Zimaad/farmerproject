## üìÇ File Structure

The project is organized into three main files for clarity and maintainability:


/AgroPredictor
|-- index.html         # The main HTML file containing the page structure.
|-- style.css          # All CSS for styling, layout, and animations.
|-- script.js          # All JavaScript for application logic and interactivity.

## üöÄ Setup and Usage

To run this project locally, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Download the Files:** Save `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` into a single folder on your computer.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

The application is fully functional out-of-the-box using mock data. To connect to live data, you will need to integrate the relevant APIs within the `script.js` file.

## üîå API Integration

The application is designed for easy integration with live data sources. The primary areas for API integration are within the `script.js` file:

* **AI Features:** The `handleRecommendationSubmit` function contains the fetch call to the **Google Gemini API**.
* **Climate Data:** The mock data objects (`mockClimateData`) can be replaced with API calls to a service like the **NASA POWER API**.
* **Market Data:** The `mockMarketData` object can be replaced with API calls to a service like the **Barchart API**.
